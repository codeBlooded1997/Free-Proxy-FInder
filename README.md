<h4>This open source web application is developed in <strong>Flask framework</strong>. This is lightweight framework which makes it good choice for doing web scraping stuff.
In this project I'm extracting information about free proxies available on other websites and storing extracted data in table whit many filtering options. It's possible to sort extracted data by Country, port, IP address, HTTPS and last checked time.
LAst but not the least, you can easily dowload all extracted data an same format(table) and have it on you own local storage.</h4>

<p>It is also possible to make search and see the particular data for example see all the free proxies from specific country.</p>
